A Mediawiki extension for embedding flash files with standards compliance, no javascript, prompts popular browsers for missing Flash plug-ins and has a built in media player for FLV or H.264 media.

OFlash uses the media player Flash file from Jeroen Wijering's FLV Media Player (http://www.jeroenwijering.com/).
